This is the code to generate the figures from:

An Efficient Semi-Real-Time Algorithm for Path Planning in the Hamilton-Jacobi Formulation
	by Christian Parkinson and Kyle Polage

The code is fairly well-commented, and the two data files "ex1.mat" and "ex2.mat" contain the
exact parameter values to generate those exact figures. 

To use, simply extract all files to a common directory, and run "driverSRT.m" in MATLAB. You can change
which example you want to see by loading the correct file on line 10 of driverSRT.m.

For the high dimensional example, run "driver_HighDim.m".
